DEV NOTE - 

This page currently doesn't doesn't render anywhere. 

If you check under user_routes.py, you'll find this:

@bp_user.route('/', methods=['GET'])
async def index(request):
    return redirect('/users')

which redirects anyone who visits the homepage to the /users page to view all users.
